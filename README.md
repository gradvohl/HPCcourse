This repository contains the source codes for the High Performance Computing course (FT077) offered at the School of Technology/Universidade Estadual de Campinas.
In short, the course will cover the OpenMP, for shared memory processing, and MPI for distributed memory processing.


## Basic repository structure
The repository is divided into three main directories:
- :file_folder: OpenMP: directory for OpenMP examples.
- :file_folder: MPI: directory for MPI examples.
